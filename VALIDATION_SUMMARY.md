# üîí Kaptifi Vision Marshal - Validation Analysis

## üîç SECURITY STANDARDS

### Certificate Structure Requirements
- **O (Organization Name)**: Must contain organization UUID
- **CN (Common Name)**: Must contain human-readable organization name
- **Organization ID**: Must match between license and certificate O field

### Validation Process
1. Certificate Validation
   - Format verification
   - Expiration check
   - Organization identity verification

2. License Validation
   - Signature verification
   - Expiration check
   - Organization ID matching
   - Module permissions verification

3. Security Checks
   - Cryptographic signature validation
   - Certificate-license binding verification
   - Tamper detection

## üõ°Ô∏è SECURITY FEATURES

### File Separation
- Certificate and license must be separate files
- No embedded certificates in license files
- Clear separation of concerns

### Field Validation
- O field must contain UUID
- CN field must contain human name
- Organization ID must match between files

### Cryptographic Security
- PSS padding with SHA256
- Certificate-based signature verification
- Expiration checks on both certificate and license

## üìã VALIDATOR FEATURES

### Security Standards Enforced
